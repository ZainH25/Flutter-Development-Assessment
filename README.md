# Flutter Assessment: 
This project is a Flutter-based application designed to display a list of trending meetups with relevant descriptions, images, and a share functionality. The app includes several screens that showcase various meetups and allows users to interact with the content. This README provides an overview of the project's structure, features, and key components.

Project Overview
In this assessment, I have created a mobile app with the following features:

Trending Meetups Page: Displays a list of trending meetups (such as Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai, and Virat Kohli) along with a horizontal scrollable gallery of images for each meetup.
Meetup Details Page: Shows detailed descriptions of the selected meetup along with additional images in a scrollable view. Each meetup has a share button that opens the mobile share options to share the event.
Image Integration: Used local images for each meetup that are loaded from the assets folder and displayed with proper scaling using BoxFit.cover.
Share Functionality: Integrated the share_plus package to enable users to share the meetup information through their device's native share options.
Screens and Features
1. Home Screen (List of Meetups)
Displays a list of top trending meetups (Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai, Virat Kohli, etc.).
Each meetup has a title, description, and a horizontal scrollable list of images (at least three images per meetup).
Users can tap on a meetup to view detailed information about it.
2. Meetup Details Screen
Shows detailed information about the selected meetup.
Includes a scrollable list of images related to the event, with a title, description, and other details.
A share button that opens the mobile share options to allow the user to share the meetup details via various channels (WhatsApp, Facebook, etc.).
3. Image Handling
All meetup images are stored in the assets/images folder, and the app is configured to load these images locally using Image.asset.
Used BoxFit.cover for proper image scaling, ensuring images are displayed without distortion and are appropriately fitted within their container.
4. Share Functionality
Integrated the share_plus package for sharing content.
Each meetup has a share button that, when clicked, opens the device's native share dialog, allowing users to share the meetup information easily.

Technologies Used
Flutter: The mobile framework used to build this app.
Dart: The programming language used for Flutter development.
share_plus Package: Used to integrate the share functionality.
Local Assets: Images stored in the assets/images/ directory.
Future Improvements
Dynamic Data: Integrate a backend to fetch real-time data for trending meetups.
User Authentication: Add user login and registration screens for personalization.
Advanced UI Features: Improve UI elements with animations, transitions, and more advanced design patterns.
Backend Integration: Implement functionality for users to create and join meetups.

Conclusion
In this project, I have successfully built a Flutter app to display trending meetups with images and descriptions. The app includes a fully functional UI that is interactive and allows users to share content. The use of local images and the share functionality is an important aspect of the app, providing users with a seamless and engaging experience.
